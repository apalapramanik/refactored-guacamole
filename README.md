# 3D Ray Tracing Framework

## Overview
This repository implements a 3D ray tracing framework for wireless communication propagation modeling. It simulates signal behavior at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, capturing effects like free-space path loss, reflections, and log-normal shadowing.

## Features
- Simulates free-space path loss, reflections, and shadowing.
- Supports up to \(N\) reflections in 3D environments.
- Visualizes ray paths and received power gradients.

## Requirements
- MATLAB or Python.
- Adequate computational resources for 3D ray tracing.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the repository and run the main script
3. View results in the output directory.
